# simulationsSM
A repository to store results of Monte Carlo simulation for the Standart Model.


## Basic Installation ##

The following codes must be installed:

  * [Pythia8](http://lcgapp.cern.ch/project/simu/HepMC/)
  * [MadGraph5](https://launchpad.net/mg5amcnlo/)

The script installer.sh will try to fetch the appropriate tarballs and install them.


## Content ##

In this repository each folder represents a single process generated with the Monte Carlo simulation. The folders contains the cards used to generate the process and some plots.

## Objectives ## 

  * Store process used to understand some characteristics of Standart Model

  * The process (p p > h, h > a a) in specifc, was generated with MadGraph5 and a simplified Monte Carlo simulator [toyGenerator](https://github.com/viniciusrocca/toyGenerator) for a comparision.


## Citation ##
